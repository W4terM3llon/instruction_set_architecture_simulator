# Instruction Set Architecture 
This is an Instruction Set Architecture simulator project that was created for 'Cyber Systems' course for Bsc. in General Engineering at Technical University of Denmark.

It includes 3 test cases, the third one was created by us. Run ```.\isa-sim.py``` file to use the project.

You can use ```.\testCases\test_3\MergeSort.py``` to compare the result from third test case.

## Running test cases

To run the 1st test case run the following from the root of the project:

```bash
  python .\isa-sim.py 1000 .\testCases\test_1\program_1.txt .\testCases\test_1\data_mem_1.txt

```
The output should be:
```

To run the 2nd test case run the following from the root of the project:

```bash
  python .\isa-sim.py 1000 .\testCases\test_2\program_2.txt .\testCases\test_2\data_mem_2.txt

You can generate new number to sort. The following script will replace data_mem_3.txt file with new numbers. 

```bash
  cd ..\..\
  python .\RandomDataMemGenerator.py 100
  cd .\testCases\test_3\
```
